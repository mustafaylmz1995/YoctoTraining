Command to run the generated image in QEMU
------------------------------------------

Quick Emulator (QEMU) is a free and open software package that performs hardware
virtualization.
The QEMU based machines allow test and development without real hardware.

Currently emulations are supported for:
  -ARM
  -MIPS
  -MIPS64
  -PowerPC
  -X86
  -X86_64

Poky provides a script 'runqemu' which will allow you to start the QEMU using
yocto generated images.

The runqemu script is run as:
  runqemu <machine> <zimage> <filesystem>
where:
  <machine> is the machine/architecture to use
  (qemuarm/qemuips/qemuppc/qemux86/qemux86-64)
  <zimage> is the machine/architecture to use
  (qemuarm/qemuips/qemuppc/qemux86/qemux86-64)
  <filesystem> is the path to an ext2 image (e.g. filesystem-qemuarm.ext2) or
  an nfs directory

Full usage instructions can be seen by running the command with no options
specified.

EXIT QEMU
---------

Exit QEMU by either clicking on the shutdown icon or by typing Ctrl-C in the
QEMU transcript window from which you evoked QEMU.

We can write poweroff in terminal to close.

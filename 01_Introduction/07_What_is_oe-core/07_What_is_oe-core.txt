OpenEmbedded Project
--------------------

From http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Main_Page

OpenEmbedded offers a best-in-class cross-compile environment. It allows
developers to create a complete Linux distribution for Embedded Systems.


What is the difference between OpenEmbedded and the Yocto Project?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded share a core collection of metadata called
openembedded-core.

However, the two organizations remain separate, each with its own focus.

OpenEmbedded provides a comprehensive set of metadata for a wide variety of
architectures, features, and applications
    Not a reference distribution
    Designed to be the foundation for others

The Yocto Project focuses on providing powerful, easy-to-use, interoperable,
well-tested tools, metadata, and board support packages (BSPs) for a core set
of architectures and specific boards.


OpenEmbedded-Core (oe-core)
---------------------------

The Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded have agreed to work together and share a
common core set of metadata (recipes, classes and associated file): oe-core

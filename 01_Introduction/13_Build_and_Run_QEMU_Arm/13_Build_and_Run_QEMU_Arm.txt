When you set up the build environment, a local configuration file named
local.conf becomes available in a conf subdirectory of the Build Directory.

The defaults are set to build for a qemux86 target

Edit ./build/conf/local.conf

Set
  MACHINE = "qemuarm"

Run the following scripts in a new terminal at the up on the build directory
  $ source source/poky/oe-init-build-env
  $ bitbake core-image-minimal
  $ runqemu core-image-minimal

Four elements of Embedded Linux
--------------------------------

Toolchain :
The "Compiler" and "other tools" needed to create code for your target device.
Everything else depends on the toolchain.

Bootloader:
The "Program" that initializes the board and loads the Linux Kernel.

Kernel:
This is the "heart of the system". Managing system resources and interfacing with
hardware.

Root File System:
"Contains the libraries and programs" that are run once the kernel has completed
its initialization.

One more element can be collection of programs specific to your embedded
application which make the device do whatever it is supposed to do, be it weigh
groceries, display movies, control a robot or fly a drone.

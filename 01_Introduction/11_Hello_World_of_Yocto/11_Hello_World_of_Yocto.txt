Workflow of Yocto Project
-------------------------

Step 1: Download the Poky Source code
$ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky

Step 2: Checkout the latest branch/release (zeus)
$ git checkout zeus

Step 3: Prepare the build environment
Poky provides you a script 'oe-init-build-env', which should be used to setup
the build environment.
Script will set up your environment to use Yocto build system, including adding
the BitBake utility to your path
$ source poky/oe-init-build-env [build_directory]

Here build_directory is an optional argument for the name of the directory where
the environment is set in case it is not given, it defaults to "build"

The above script will move you in a build folder and create two files
( local.conf, bblayers.conf ) inside conf folder

Step 4: Building Linux Distribution
$ bitbake <image_name>
$ time bitbake core-image-minimal

core-image-minimal
------------------

This is a small image allowing a device to boot, and it is very useful for
kernel and boot loader tests and development

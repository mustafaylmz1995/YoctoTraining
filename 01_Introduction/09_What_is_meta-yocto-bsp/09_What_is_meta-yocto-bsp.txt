meta-yocto-bsp
--------------

A board Support Package (BSP) is a collection of information that defines how to
support a particular hardware devices, set of devices, or hardware platform.

The BSP includes information about the hardware features present on the device
and kernel configuration information along with any additional hardware drivers
required.

The BSP also lists any additional software components required in addition to a
generic Linux software stack for both essential and optional platform features.

The meta-yocto-bsp layer in Poky maintains several BSPs such as the beaglebone,
EdgeRouter, and generic versions of both 32-bit and 64-bit IA machines.


Machines supported
------------------
  Texas Instruments BeagleBone (beaglebone)
  Freescale MPC8315E-RDB (mpc8315e-rdb)
  Intel x86-base PCs and devices (genericx86 and genericx86-64)
  Ubiquiti Networks EdgeRouter Lite (edgerouter)

Note: To develop on different hardware, you will need to complement Poky with
hardware-specific Yocto layers.

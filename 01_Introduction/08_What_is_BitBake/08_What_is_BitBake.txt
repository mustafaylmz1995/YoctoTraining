What is BitBake?
---------------

Bitbake is a core component of the Yocto Project.

It is basically performs the same functionality as of make.

It's a task scheduler that parses python and shell script mixed core.

The code parsed generates and runs tasks, which are basically a set of steps
ordered according to code's dependencies.

It reads recipes and follows them by fetching packages, building them and
incorporating the results into bootable images.

It keeps track of all tasks being processed in order to ensure completion,
maximizing the use of processing resources to reduce build time and being
predictable
